# EndangerEdDemo

A demo for the EndangerEd project which is my final project for my Software and Knowledge Engineering degree.

This mainly not just "simulate" or "demo" how the game work but also show how the game is made and some real 
"slideshow" that's not just a slideshow but you can also "play" it!
